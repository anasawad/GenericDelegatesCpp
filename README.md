# GenericDelegatesCpp
C++ Generic Delegates implementation using variadic templates

In this implementation I tried to make it:
- Generic as much as possible.
- Readable syntax and well commented [not complete].
- well designed [not complete].

Examples are included in the .cpp file.

This implementation is explined [here](https://anasmehassab.wordpress.com/2015/01/05/generic-delegates-c-implementation/)
